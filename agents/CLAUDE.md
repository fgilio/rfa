# Agent Artifacts

All generated artifacts during Claude Code sessions (research, analysis, plans, investigations) go here.

## Naming Convention

- Prefix all files with a `YYYYMMDD-` timestamp (date of creation)
- Use lowercase kebab-case for the rest of the filename
- Example: `20260216-architecture-audit.md`
